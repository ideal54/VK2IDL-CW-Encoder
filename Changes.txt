Version 1.0
Initial release

Version 1.0a
1. Corrected a buffer processing issue where typing 5 on the keyboard resulted in sending morse code
   for '1' instead of '5'. The issue was caused by incorrect array counting which failed to process
   the last character in the array (the last character being a '5').

2. Made changes to the LCD text display code to provide tidier text display on the LCD. Also added 
   code to display the morse speed on the LCD.

3. Tidied up some code for clearer reading.
